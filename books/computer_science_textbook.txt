INPUT, PROCESSING & OUTPUT
Computer systems all have input, processing and output. When you think of a computer system you
may picture a desktop computer or laptop, but it could easily be a mobile phone, games console or
your DVD player. They are all computer systems that have inputs, processing and outputs.
Examples of computer systems
Write below examples of computer systems that you may have in your house.
Importance of computer systems Page 5
COMPUTER FUNDAMENTALS
Computer systems have a number of things in common. They all have take an INPUT and
PROCESS it using instructions called programs. The results of the processing are shown as
OUTPUTS. Computer systems can store programs and data for later use.

THE IMPORTANCE OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS
Computer systems are used in almost every aspect of our lives. They have become important in our
society and have brought us great advantages in our lives.
How have computers helped us in the following areas?
Business
Medicine
Entertainment

COMPUTER FUNDAMENTALS
RELIABILITY
It is important for computer systems to be
reliable. Some systems need to be more
reliable than others however.
When we say something is reliable, we
mean that it does what we expect. Many
computers are complex pieces of
hardware running complex software.
Occasionally something will go wrong,
such as a program may crash or a piece of
hardware such as a hard drive may fail.
Some computer systems could put people
in danger if they fail or even lead to death. If your games console fails and a game crashes, whilst it
is frustrating it does not compare with a computer system on an air liner. If a computer system on an
aeroplane fails, it could lead to the plane crashing and people being killed.
There are different ways of measuring reliability.
One way is to measure how often a system is
down for in a given time. So for example if a
Superstore’s computer systems were run for
100 hours and in that time, computer failure
resulted in the computers not working for 3
hours then we could say that the system has a
97% reliability. The Superstore company would
have to decide whether this was acceptable or
not.
If you need to have a computer system that is
close to being 100% reliable then extra steps would need to be taken to make sure that things do
not fail.

COMPUTERS AND THE LAW
COMPUTER MISUSE ACT
In the 1980’s a number of people were caught hacking into other people’s computer systems but
the law at the time was not able to deal with these new crimes.
The Computer Misuse Act 1990 was designed to protect the integrity of computer systems by
deterring the activities of hackers. It created three new offences:
• Unauthorised access to computer programs or data
• Unauthorised access with a further criminal intent (known as the ‘ulterior intent’ offence)
• Unauthorised modification of computer material.
So what does all this mean? Well to start
with it makes hacking illegal. Hacking is
accessing a computer either physically or
remotely, without the user’s permission. So
you are not allowed to access a person’s
computer or work area or look at the data
stored there without the permission of the
person whose data it is. This means
hacking into some’s email account is illegal.
This could lead to a fine of up to £5000 or
6 months in prison.
If the hacker then makes a change to any data on the computer system or they use their access to
commit a further crime, like fraud or blackmail, they could face up to 5 years in prison. This is in
addition to the sentence given for that additional crime.
Some people write computer viruses. These pieces of
software can travel from computer to computer and often
change data on an infected machine. This means that
virus writers can be sent to prison for up to 5 years.
Computers and the law Page 10

How do you think the following people have broken the laws in the Computer Misuse Act?
A WPC used police national computer to access electoral rolls and car registration records in
attempts to track down woman who had an affair with her boyfriend.
A disgruntled IT supplier hacked estate agency website and replaced pictures of houses with
inappropriate images.
An employee who is about to made redundant finds the Managing Director’s password; logs into the
computer system using this and looks at some confidential files.
Computers and the law Page 11
COMPUTER FUNDAMENTALS
DATA PROTECTION ACT
Many companies collect personal data which they use for their business. Some of this data is vital to
the day to day running of these companies, such as being able to insure a car or house, or deliver
goods. However this data can be valuable in other ways. If a car insurance company knew the
names and addresses of who bought cars and when, then they could target them for mail shots at
the right time for insurance renewal. The chances of getting a response would be higher.
It was decided that the company who collects the data must look after it and can only pass it on
with the owner’s permission. The Data Protection Act has eight statements about how a company
must look after personal data they store. Failing to uphold these statements could lead to criminal
prosecution.
• Personal data must be obtained and processed fairly and lawfully.
• Personal data must be held only for the purposes which the data user has declared. Personal
data must not be used for purposes other than those which have been declared.
• The personal data kept for the declared purpose must be relevant, adequate, and not excessive
in relation to that purpose.
• Personal data should be accurate and kept up to date (where appropriate).
• Personal data must not be kept longer than is necessary for the purpose for which it is held.
• An individual is entitled to find out whether and what data is held on him or her and, where
appropriate, to have such data corrected or erased.
• Appropriate measures must be taken to prevent unauthorised access, or modification of personal
data.
• Data should not transferred outside the UK without adequate protection.
COPYRIGHT & PATENTS ACT
With digital data, making copies has never been easier. Even though it is easy however, does not
make it legal. Many things are covered under the copyright law such as music, film, photographs
and software. Making copies of such items and sharing them with friends is often against copyright
law and as such can be prosecuted.
When buying a software pack it usually comes with a license that covers its use. This licence will
inform you how many computers you are allowed to install the software onto.

COMPUTER FUNDAMENTALS
ETHICS
Laws are there to prevent and punish illegal behaviour but there are some situations that are not
covered by the law. These are often ethical issues.
Imagine a company could buy a computer system that would do the work of 50 people and could
work 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. This could save the company a great deal of money and so
would make sense commercially. However just making 50 people unemployed would be unethical.
The company has an obligation to look after its work force. This may mean retraining them so they
can work in areas that computer systems are not so well suited for.
Employers need to make sure they respect health and safety regulations for their computer users.
This may mean paying for eye tests and providing equipment to make it easier for people with
disabilities to work effectively.
A superstore chain in the USA used loyalty cards to track user purchases and to target vouchers.
They were able to use buying habits to predict
which women were pregnant and estimate when
they would give birth. They were able to target
vouchers for baby goods before the baby was
born. Is this ethical? What would happen if the
women didn’t want to announce the pregnancy
and started receiving coupons for nappies and
baby food?
What do you think should be in a code of conduct for a computer company that is employed to
create software for a number of different clients?

COMPUTER FUNDAMENTALS
PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS
THE NEED FOR STANDARDS
Most computer programs are very complex and require teams of people working together to
complete the task. This requires some organisation if the program is going to work and perform the
tasks required of it. There are many different standards that have been created for the design,
development and testing of software.
When creating a new computer system a number of stages need to be gone through in order to
implement a solution effectively.
Analysis of the current system. Understand what the current system does (if there is one), including
what works well and what doesn’t work well.
• Designing a new solution. Creating a new computer system to replace the old one, hopefully
taking note of the things that don’t work well with the old system so they can be avoided.
• Implementation the new system according to the design.
• Testing the solution. This may have a number of stages. Alpha testing is usually done by the
programmers to test against their designs. Beta testing often involves the end users so they can
test it doing the types of jobs they do in real life situations.
• Installing and training. This means putting in the new system and make sure the users have been
trained sufficiently to do their job.
Explain what is meant by the following types of standards.
Proprietary Standards
Open Standards
Professional Standards Page 15
COMPUTER FUNDAMENTALS
Defacto Standards
Industry Standards
Standards in Software Development
The programmers need to adhere to standards when they work in teams. Programs are usually
broken down into chunks that can be implemented independently. In this way many programmers
can work on a different parts of the program.
For example if a new word processor is being written, one programmer may work on the code to
format the text, while another programmer may work on making tables work and yet another may
implement a spell checker.
These separate tasks need to come together to work as a whole. The programmers need to make
sure the interaction of the various parts work well together.

COMPUTERS AND THE ENVIRONMENT
RECYCLING
The electronic circuit boards and components used in making modern computer devices often
contain valuable materials. Much of the wiring is made of copper, which is a good electrical
conductor. Small amounts of gold may be used instead, which is an even better conductor. There
are also other rare metals such as tantalum. When computer systems such as PCs, games consoles
and mobile phones come to the end of their usefulness
they can often be thrown away. This is extremely wasteful.
Laws have been passed in many countries to ensure that
computer systems can be recycled easily or their life
extended. Many businesses and organisations run
powerful computers that when they become too slow to
do the work they were purchased for, are often useful for
schools and charities as well as in developing countries.
There are companies that will even buy you old mobile
phone and refurbish it before selling it to developing countries. In developing countries mobile
phones can often be used in areas where it would not be economical to have fixed line telephones,
and so there is big demand.
Manufacturers also are being forced to make sure that the electronics they create can be more easily
recycled to get the precious metals and other materials back so they can be used to make the next
generation of gadgets.
ENERGY EFFICIENCY
We use computer systems so much in todays lifestyle that they are now making up a significant role
in our usage of electricity. The electronics in your house hold could contribute around 6% of your
electricity bill. Modern computer systems are designed to save energy when not in use. There are
energy saving settings in most modern operating systems that allow you to configure your computer
so that it can save energy when you are not using it.
What features are there on modern computers that help make them energy efficient?

THE CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT
The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the brain of the computer. It is the part of the computer that
carries out the instructions of the computer system.
The CPU has understands a number of instructions. The CPU has two
parts. The Arithmetic Logic Unit which performs arithmetic and logical
operations such as addition, subtraction and comparing values. The
Control Unit gets instructions from memory (RAM), decodes them and
executes the instructions, using the ALU when needed. Putting it simply,
the CPU fetches instructions and then executes them. There are three
basic types of instructions.
• Get some data from RAM and perform some arithmetic or logic on it
such as add them together, multiply them together or compare them
(such as decide which number is the largest).
• Move data from one part of memory to another.
• Make a decision and fetch a different instruction from memory based on that decision.
•
There are a number of factors that effect the speed of the processor.
Explain how these factors affect the speed of the computer’s CPU.

BINARY LOGIC
JUST ON AND OFF
For all the complexity of a computer system, at their heart is something really simple. The CPU, and
the memory are just a series of switches. These switches have two settings, on or off. There are
billions of switches that make up a modern computer, and all the data and programs that run on
them must be stored on a series of switches that are either on or off. The CPU when it processes
instructions, really just turns different switches on and off. It is when the settings of these switches
are turned into something we can understand, like a sound or pixels on a screen, that we can
interpret what the computer has done.
In order for the computer system to be able to make decisions about which switches to turn on or
off, there are a series of circuits called gates. These take a signal which can either be on or off, and
then alter it in some way. These gates are called logic gates. By combining them in different ways
the computer system can make decisions. Its using logic gates that enable the computer system to
work.
The NOT Gate
This is the simplest of the logic gates. The symbol for a logic gate is shown below.
The NOT gate takes a signal A and inverts it. This means that if A is ON then Y will be OFF. Similarly
if A is OFF then Y will be on. This can be shown in a table known as a truth table.
INPUT A OUTPUT Y
1
0
Binary Logic Page 27
COMPUTER HARDWARE
The OR Gate
The OR gate takes two inputs. Each of these inputs can be ON or OFF. Diagram for an OR gate is
shown below.
The OR gate is so called because if input A or Input B are on then output Y will be on too. This can
be shown in the truth table.
Notice that even if A and B are on then the output Y is on.
The AND Gate
The AND gate has two inputs like the OR gate. It gets its name from the fact that both inputs A and
B need to be on for the output Y to be on. The diagram for an AND gate is shown below.
INPUT A INPUT B OUTPUT Y
1 0
0 0
1 1
0 1
INPUT A INPUT B OUTPUT Y
1 0
0 0
1 1
0 1
Binary Logic Page 28
COMPUTER HARDWARE
COMBINING GATES
In a computer chip these logic gates can be combined to make more complex gates, to make more
complex decisions. Take a look at the example below.
It is an OR gate that flows into a NOT gate. If A or B are on then C will be on. If C is on then the NOT
gate will invert that switch and turn it off.
Writing a truth table is often a good idea to see all the different combinations and allows us to work
out what is going on more easily.
So we can see that as long as there is an input in A or B the final result will be that Y is off. Only
when A and B are both off will the output Y be on.
Lets have a look at another example.
Here we have a NOT gate moving into one of the inputs of an AND gate. So lets look at our truth
table for this.
INPUT A INPUT B OUTPUT C OUTPUT Y

MEMORY
Computers need to remember a lot of data. This includes all the programs that are currently running,
all the data associated with those programs, along with data to do with the computer’s current
settings, user input and output. All this data is stored in the computer’s memory. There are two types
of computer memory, RAM and ROM.
RAM stands for Random Access Memory. It is called random access memory because the data
stored in it can be accessed in any order. ROM stands for Read Only Memory.
Complete the table below for the differences between RAM and ROM.
VIRTUAL RAM
Modern operating systems have a way of using the hard disc to extend the amount of RAM available
to the computer. This virtual memory enables computer systems to act like they have more RAM
than they have by using the hard disc.
Reading and writing from the hard disc is much slower than using RAM, so one way to increase the
speed of a computer system is to have more RAM and rely less on virtual memory.
RAM ROM
Memory Page 30

INPUT & OUTPUT DEVICES
Input and output devices allow us to communicate with and control computer systems and enable
them to communicate with us in ways we can understand. There are a variety of different input and
output devices, each suited to a particular job.
INPUT DEVICES
Device Description
Keyboard The keyboard is probably the most common type of
input device on a computer system. The keyboard is
inspired by mechanical type writers, and still adopts the
QWERTY layout of keys. Pressing a key on a keyboard
to input some data. Sometimes the key press creates a
letter on the screen, while a combination of keystrokes
can cause a more complex action.

COMPUTER HARDWARE
STORAGE DEVICES
Why we need to store?
Computers need computer programs to run and data to manipulate. When the computer system is
working, these are stored in the memory or RAM. When a computer system is turned off, all the
programs and data stored in RAM are lost. If you had to type in a computer program every time you
wanted to use it, it would be a very slow and tedious task. Some modern computer programs can
be millions of lines of code long. Entering a document over and over again would also be a waste of
time.
Computers need a way of storing data so that it can be loaded into RAM quickly when the computer
system is turned on again. We also need to be able to transport data from one computer to another.
Computer systems have different ways of storing data. These ways each have their advantages and
disadvantages and can hold different amounts of data.
Magnetic Discs
Most computer systems have a hard disc drive. This is used to store the operating system,
programs and data and is usually located inside the computer system itself. The hard disc is a
platter of metal that can be magnetised. The disc spins rapidly and arm can move across the disc to
read or write data. In some hard discs there may be more than one platter to increase the storage
capacity.
Advantages
Disadvantages
Storage Devices Page 34
COMPUTER HARDWARE
Optical Discs
These drives use lasers to read from an optical disc such as a CD, DVD or a Blu-ray disc. The disc is
removable and so can be used in a number of computers. Many optical discs
are read only. Once the data has been encoded on the disc, it cannot
be altered. It is often used to store the installation program for
software. So a DVD disc is used to install or copy the
important files onto a computer’s hard drive. Once this
is done the DVD is not needed, unless you
need to install the software again.

Storage Devices Page 35
COMPUTER HARDWARE
Solid State
These are erasable ROM chips that can be wiped and written to electronically, but when the power
is off they retain the data stored on them. These discs were
initially used for removable storage for portable devices such as
digital cameras. The removable discs have a limit to their
capacity due to their size. They do have a limit to how many times
they can be erased and re-written to, but advances in technology
make the latest drives comparable with hard discs in terms of life
span.

SOFTWARE
WHAT IS SOFTWARE?
Without software to make them work, computer systems are just electronic circuits without
instructions telling them what to do.
Software is the why we use a computer. These are the programs that allow us to do
something useful with our computer.
OPERATING SYSTEMS
Most modern computer systems, from laptops to phones to games consoles, need to have
some software that makes the hardware work properly. This is called an Operating System
(OS).
Can you name some operating systems?
The Operating System (OS) allows the programs that run on the computer to interact with
the different hardware in a consistent way. When you
save a document to a disc, you don’t need to worry
about whether it is a hard disc from one manufacturer or
a solid state drive from another. The way the data is
written to these discs is different, but the OS hides these
differences from the user and the programmer who wrote
your application.
The OS enables your computing device to communicate
with the different hardware that can connect to your
computer, from disc drives and printers to monitors and
network connections. When you need to use these
different devices the OS provides a consistent way to use
them.
Operating Systems Page 45

Application

Hardware
SOFTWARE
When you get a new piece of hardware you will get a driver that enables the OS to
communicate with it. So when you when you want to print a document, the OS loads the
printer driver for the printer you want to use. It provides a similar set of options no matter
which printer you use. There may be some options though that are specific to each printer.
When you want to save a document to a drive the Operating System takes care of that. It
uses the appropriate device driver for the hardware and passes the document data to the
driver. The driver takes that data and gives instructions as to how to save that data to the
device. These instructions would be different if the data is being saved to a hard drive or a
solid state USB memory stick or a writable CDR. The Operating system gives the user the
same interface and experience, even though how the data gets saved may be different each
time.
If there is no device driver available for a piece of hardware then it will not work and is not
compatible with your Operating System.

SOFTWARE
INTERFACES
The OS provides the interface for the user to interact with the computer system. There are
different types of interfaces.

SOFTWARE
MANAGING MEMORY
The OS manages how memory is given to applications so they do not clash. When you start
a new program or load a file the OS assigns each its own computer memory space so they
do not interfere with each other.
What type of computer memory are computer programs loaded into?
What is the size of computer memory measured in?
MANAGING STORAGE
When the computer is turned off all data is wiped from the computer’s memory. So
programs and data can easily be loaded back into memory they are stored.
What type of devices can be used to store programs and data for computer systems?
Operating Systems Page 50
SOFTWARE
Before a storage device can be used it needs to be formatted before it can be used. The
OS does this. When a hard disc is formatted. This breaks the disc down into chunks that
the OS can address. Each region can store some data and each region has an address so
the OS can read and write data.
SECURITY
The OS also deals with system security. This makes sure that only certain users can perform
particular actions like install new software and delete files. Each user has a username and a
password and the OS can give each user permissions to be able to carry out various tasks.

UTILITY SOFTWARE
There are some programs that come with the OS or that can be bought separately, that can
help keep the computer running smoothly. There are a number of different types of utility
software.
There are a number of types of utility software.
ANTI-VIRUS SOFTWARE
This software scans the computer for viruses and removes any found. It can also prevent
any new viruses from infecting the computer.

SOFTWARE
FIREWALL
When you connect to a network such as the Internet, there is data leaving your computer
and data returning. A firewall is software (or sometimes hardware) that checks data travelling
along the network connection and blocks it if is not allowed.
How might a firewall be used in school to protect students?
How does a firewall help prevent you from being attacked by hackers?
SPYWARE PROTECTION
Some software that you install monitors what you do without you knowing. It may monitor
your Internet use or log your key presses.
What type of data could the spyware monitor?
Utility Software Page 53
SOFTWARE
DISK DEFRAGMENT
When you add files and programs to a new computer it can often slow down. This is often
due to the the way some OS’s save files. Each sector on the hard disc is capable of holding
files of a certain size. If a file is bigger than one sector it may take up a number of sectors.
Sometimes when the OS saves a file it starts saving it some sectors but runs out before the
file is completely saved. It then breaks up the file and saves the rest in a different part of the
hard drive. This means that the file is in fragments. Reading the file can be slow as the
mechanical read/write heads on the drive need to move to different parts of the disc.
Defragmenting a drive moves the fragments so they are all together on the disc.
Draw what the files in a hard disc may look like in a fragmented drive.
Draw what the disc would look like after it has been defragmented.

TYPES OF SOFTWARE
OFF THE SHELF SOFTWARE
Most, if not all the software on your computer will be off the shelf software.
Most people start with software that has been written by someone else, usually a software
company, that designs software to sell to a mass market. This software includes programs
like image editing packages and office applications like word processors, spreadsheets and
databases. These programs have mass appeal because they can be used for a variety of
tasks. A word processor for example can be used to write a thank you letter to grandma, a
school report or your next novel. As result these types of software packages are known as
general purpose software for their ability to perform a number of related tasks.
The price and availability of off the shelf software is often low. The more specialised the
market for that type of software, the higher the price, due to the fact that fewer people
would buy the software. A simple word processor like Apple’s Pages may cost a few
pounds while Microsoft Word has more features and so costs more.

BESPOKE SOFTWARE
Sometimes the software available for purchase just doesn’t meet the needs of what you
require. In these instances you can have the software custom written for you needs. There
are considerable challenges and costs involved but the result is that you get a piece of
software that does exactly what you want. This custom designed software is known as
bespoke software.
The advantages of bespoke software are:
The disadvantages of bespoke software are:
Types of Software Page 56
SOFTWARE
OPEN SOURCE V PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE
Proprietary software is software that you buy from a company. They write the programming code to
make the application and this code is then compiled to produce the binary executable program that
they sell on disc or as a download. You cannot look at the code that was used to make the
program. That code belongs to the software development company that wrote the program. They
will often guard this code as it makes sure that the techniques they used cannot be used by other
people freely. The company often wants to guard it their code so as to have a competitive advantage
over other companies. A lot of the programs that you have bought will be proprietary. If you want a
feature adding to the software, or you have found a bug, then you need to wait for the software
developer to do that. This may take some time and in the case of new features, may never happen.
Proprietary software will often be developed behind closed doors, so that customers do not know
what features are being developed in new versions of the software and when they may arrive.
Proprietary software can often lock users into using that software, making sure that data cannot be
transferred easily to other programs, especially those of a competitor. This makes it difficult to
change to a different program.
What is Open Source Software?
Some programmers create programs and then share the code they used with other people. In this
way the source code is open and anyone can see how it works, make changes and improvements,
contributing to the continued development of the software. Open source software is often free, and
can have hundreds of developers around the world contributing to the development of the software.
There are many open sources projects, many trying to mimic proprietary applications.
The advantage of open source software is that you can download the source code and see how it
works. Changes can be made to give the software the features you want without having to write a
program from scratch.
Many, (though not all) open source programs have many developers from all over the world working
on them. As there are so many developers looking at the code and checking it, bugs get found and
fixed more rapidly than proprietary software. It can be more quickly updated. The web browsers like
Firefox and Chrome are open source. Whilst some of the big open source applications like Blender
and Linux have books written about them, some of the smaller projects have very little in the way of
documentation, let alone a published book or tutorial.
Open source projects often have a roadmap published showing a plan for when features are going
to be added. This can make it easy to see when an important feature may be added. Some open
source projected are released before being version 1 and so may be lacking some features, and
there may still be bugs in the application.

THE NEED TO REPRESENT DATA DIFFERENTLY?
There are 10 types of people in the world. Those who understand binary and those who
don’t.
If that quote doesn’t make any sense now then hopefully by the end of this chapter it will.
In primary school when learning about place value you may have put headings above numbers like
the table below.
Can you remember what do the headings mean? They stand for hundreds, tens and units. The
smallest digit that a column can hold is 0 while the largest is 9. If 1 is added to a column then that
column goes back to 0 and 1 is added to the next column. So when 1 is added to 9 this becomes
10. So we now have 1 ten and no units.
How data is stored in computers
Computers are made up from millions of switches. These switches can be ON or OFF. Everything in
a computer from numbers to text, from sounds to pictures must be converted into a series of ON’s
and OFF’s.
Computer scientists often think of these switches as 0s and 1s.
0 = OFF
1 = ON
Each 0 or 1 is known as a binary digit or Bit.
Computers would be pretty useless if the biggest number it could deal with was the number 1
unless it had a way of storing larger numbers from a series of 0s and 1s. This is Binary. It is a way of
storing numbers as a series of 0s and 1s.

BINARY
Introduction to Binary
Computers often group together 8 bits. This makes one byte.
Just like in denary (the number system we use) we often use column headings to remind us of the
place value.
This is the number 1. Each column heading is a power of 2.
How to convert from denary to binary
You often need to convert a number from denary into binary.
How to convert 37 into a binary number.
What is the biggest number that goes into 37 without going over. Looking at the grid 32 is the
highest number, so we put a 1 in that column.
Now we take 32 from 37.
This leaves 5. Now we repeat the process.
4 goes into 5 without going over. So we put a 1 in the 4 column.
That leaves us with 1. So we can put a 1 in the 1 column and then this is our answer.
So 37 in binary is 00100101 or just 100101.

Converting binary numbers into denary
This is much easier. It is just a matter of adding up the columns which contain a 1.
Convert 01010110 into denary.
Put the numbers under the place headings.
So the answer is 64+16+4+2 = 86.

Exercise
Add the following pairs of binary numbers. Answers as an eight bit binary number.
HEXADECIMAL
Hexadecimal is another number system used in computer science. It is often used as a shorthand
way of writing a binary number.
Hexadecimal is a base 16 number system. So the column headings are based on powers of 16.
This gives us a problem as the number 16 has 2 digits and number systems need to have just a
single digit in each column.
So the number 10 above in base 16 is the same as 16 in denary, 1 sixteen and zero units. The
problem arises when we have more than 9 units.
The example above us impossible. If we were to write down 010 in base 16 we would confuse it
with the previous example.
00000111 + 00000011
00011000 + 00000101

The solution is to use letters instead of numbers. So the values that you can get in a column in base
16 are as follows.
So if we want to display the number 12 as a hexadecimal number we would write C. We would write
20 in hexadecimal as 14 and we would write 31 in hexadecimal as 1F (one 16 and 15 units).
How is this used as a short cut for a binary number?
Well look at the following binary number.
We can split this into two 4 bit chunks (nibbles) like this.
Looking at the right most digits we can see that it is the number 12 in denary. We can write this as
the hexadecimal number C.
Now looking at the left most digits in the same way. We will deal with the column headings just like
we did for the right most digits.

So 1010 in binary is ten in denary.
We would write this as A in hexadecimal. So the binary number 10101100 can be written more
simply as AC in hexadecimal.
Remember that AC means:
So this means there are 10 sixteens and 12 units. This makes 160 + 12 = 172.
Checking this against the binary 10101100 we have 128 + 32 + 8 + 4 = 172
Lets look at another example. The number 01101001 in binary would result in:

Converting from denary to hexadecimal and back again
To convert a number from denary to hexadecimal we first divide the number by 16. So if we look at
the denary number 75. If we divide 75 by 16 we get 4 remainder 11(16 * 4 = 64 so 75 - 64 gives us
a remainder of 11). So the number in the 16s column is 4 and we have 11 units. Remember we
need to use letters for denary numbers above 9. So 11 is B in hex.
So 75 in denary is the same as 4B in hexadecimal.
To convert a hexadecimal number into denary we need to first convert any letters into numbers.
Then multiply the first digit by 16 and add on the units. So converting E6 into denary would be 14 x
16 + 6 = 230

So we now know that the smallest piece of data that can be stored on a computer is one binary digit
or Bit. This can only store two values, 0 and 1. We have already said that in computers bits are

number and then stored as a binary sequence. The computer deals with data depending on the
instructions given to it.
TEXT
Character sets
Just like numbers, text needs to be stored as a binary code too. Each letter has a particular binary
code. It is important for transfer of information that the binary codes used for each character are
known between Operating Systems, so that data can be accurately transferred between computers
no matter what type of computer system is used.
Character sets are nothing new.
Morse code has a character set to describe the codes
used for letters and numbers. As each telegraph
operator knew morse code it made it possible to
transmit text in a binary form (dots and dashes).
When computers were developed, they needed a way to
store text that could be encoded. The problem with
morse code is that each character has a different length.
The byte is the unit of data storage in a computer and so
it using this unit that the text has to be stored.
ASCII
One of the first character sets created was ASCII. This stands for American Standard Code for
Information Interchange. This encoded 128 characters in a 7 bit binary code. The characters
encoded included the alphabet (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, punctuation marks and non
printing characters such as a line break and a carriage return. The final bit of the eight bit byte was
initially used as a check digit. Check digits are used to make sure that the data has been transferred
correctly.
As computers became more popular and used internationally, problems arose with languages such
as French and German which have accents on some of their characters. As 8 bit Operating Systems
were becoming the norm then ASCII was extended to include other glyphs such as accented letters
and mathematical symbols such as ÷, ≠ and π.

Unicode
In the 2000’s it became clear that ASCII did not have enough characters for all the symbols that
needed to be used. Some languages such as Japanese and Mandarin have character sets that are
much bigger than the latin character sets used by the west. Also some languages such as Arabic
are read from right to left.
Unicode was developed to store letters as a 16 bit code. As more bits are used then more
characters could be encoded. Unicode was designed to be large enough so that would it
encompass all the characters in all the major languages of the world.
Most modern computer systems use Unicode to store text.
Remember that the letter is not actually stored, but a binary code to represent that character. When
the computer reads that data, a computer program has to figure out which character to display on
the screen for each binary code.
There is also a problem when storing numbers. The binary code for the digits 0-9 is not the binary
numbers 0-9. The ASCII value for the character 5 is 53 in binary. In some computer programs data
may be stored as text or as numbers. If a calculation needs to be done on numbers which have
been stored as text characters, then the data will need to be converted into the right data type first.

IMAGES
Pixels
Images are broken down into tiny coloured squares called picture elements or pixels for short. Each
pixel represents just one colour.
Different images can store different numbers of colours. A simple black an white image only needs to
store two colours, black and white, and so an image could store the colours as a simple binary
sequence.
Example
The following binary sequence could be used to store this simple picture of an umbrella.

DATA REPRESENTATION
In the example above a 1 represents black and a 0 represents white.
If we want more colours then we need to use more data to represent more colours. If we use more
bits to represent each colour then we can have more colours available to use. This is known as an
image’s colour depth.
To display photographic images on the screen 3
whole bytes (24 bits) are used to represent the
colour of each pixel. This is split up into one byte for
each of the primary colours of light, red, green and
blue. This is because computer displays uses these
primary colours of light to display all the different
colours we see on the screen. By mixing the three
colours with different intensities the display is able to
show over 16 million different colours.
The amount of red, green and blue is usually stored
as an 8 bit value, giving 256 levels of brightness for
each colour (zero representing no colour and 255
representing the maximum brightness of that colour). So to represent bright yellow the values 255,
255,0 can be used to represent the brightness of red, green and blue.

Image resolution
Image resolution is a measure of how much detail there is in the image. Resolution is defined as the
ability to distinguish between two points. In a high resolution image it will be easier to distinguish
between two dots close together, while in a low resolution image the two dots may become blurred
into one shape. A high resolution image has smaller pixels and so can pack in more into a smaller
space. This results in a sharper image, however the file will be larger as it requires more pixels and
so more data needs to be stored.
Metadata
As well as the data about the pixels there is other data that is stored with the
image that describes the file. This type of data is called metadata as it
describes the image data. Most images contain some basic meta data such as
the image height, width or colour depth.
Some digital cameras also store metadata in the photographs that are taken. This information may
include data about the camera’s settings when the image was taken, such as the focal length of the
lens and the exposure settings. If the camera has GPS it may also store the data about where the
image was taken too. Data stored in my photograph contains data about my camera settings, the
file size and dimensions, the date and time it was taken as well as the GPS coordinates it was taken
at.

DATA REPRESENTATION
IMAGE FILES
There are three main image files that are used on the Internet. All of them are designed to compress
the image to make it smaller so that it be transmitted over the Internet faster. The files all compress
data in different ways.
JPEGs
Jpeg files are usually used to store images with lots of colours and complex shading. These are
generally photographs. Look at this photograph.
The image is split up into a grid. Each block on the grid is dealt with individually.

The image is split up into regions using a grid
Each block in the grid is dealt with on its own.

The shades of the colours are compared with their neighbours. If the shades are similar then they will
be combined. This loses data and so a Jpeg is a lossy format.

DATA REPRESENTATION
GIFs
GIFs can only store a maximum of 256 colours, one of which can be transparent. This means that it
works best for cartoon like graphics and logos. Look at the graphic to the left. If we assign values to
the pixels where: Blue = x Red = y Green = z, now we can describe this image row by row. The first
row is all blue, so five x's would represent the five blue pixels in the first row. The following rows are a
little more complicated:
1: x-x-x-x-x
2: x-y-y-z-z
3: y-z-y-z-y
4: z-z-z-y-z
5: x-x-x-x-x
When a GIF is compressed, the description could look more like
this:
1: 5x
2: x-2y-2z
3: y-z-y-z-y
4: 3z-y-z
5: 5x
As you can see, longer stretches of a solid color make the file more compressible (lines 1 and 5 are
the most compressed) and speckled images cannot compress (line 3 is not compressed at all).
When the color changes with each pixel in a row, there is no shorter way to convey the information.
So images with large blocks of the same colour compress very well. As data is not lost when the
image is compressed the file format is lossless.
Storing Images Page 84
DATA REPRESENTATION
SOUND
Analogue Sound
Sounds are analogue signals. This means that the sound wave has a range of values. Look at the
blue sound wave below. The height of the wave (amplitude) is the volume of the sound. The distance
between two peaks is known as the frequency and corresponds to the pitch of the sound.
The distance between each peak is known as the frequency and is measured in hertz. The height of
the wave (amplitude) corresponds to the loudness.
Digital Conversion
The sound wave needs to be converted to into numbers that can be stored in binary. To convert an
analogue sound into a digital sound, the computer samples the height of the sound wave a number
of times a second.
The number of samples in one second is known
as the sample rate. This is measured in Hertz (samples per second) or more commonly Kilo Hertz
(1000 Hz). A CD quality sound is sampled at 44kHz. This means the sound wave is checked 44,000
times a second and the height of the wave at that point is stored as a binary number. This is
represented by the yellow bars. Notice that this does not follow the pink analogue line perfectly. The
more times a sound wave is sampled in one second the closer to the original sound wave and the
Storing Sound Page 85
DATA REPRESENTATION
better it will sound. This however results in a larger file. When music is recorded in a studio it is often
sampled at 192kHz.
Saving files such as MP3 and WAV files with a lower sample rate will compress a file. This is a lossy
compression as data is lost in the re-sampling and cannot be brought back. MP3 files also saved
take advantage of the way our ear works to combine two frequencies to make one without any
perceivable loss of quality.
Another factor that determines the quality of the sound as it is digitised is the amount of data used
to store the height of the wave. This is know as the bit rate.
A 2 bit number can only have 4 possible values. This would not accurately measure the different
possible wave heights. If we used 8 bits there would be 255 different levels of volume that could be
encoded. This would result in telephone quality sound. For music 16 bits are more commonly used,
giving 65536 different possible values for the height of the wave. This can more accurately give a
smoother transition between different volumes.

INSTRUCTIONS
Encoding Instructions
When the first computers were created they were just simple calculating devices. If you wanted to
change what the computer did then you needed to rewire the computer.
In World War II an American scientist called John Von Neumann was thinking about this problem. He
thought that there was no difference between data and a digital instruction. He thought that both
data and the computer programs that work on that data could be stored in the computers memory.
The instructions could determine which data to retrieve from which memory location and what to do
with it. This is called a store-program computer and is the basis for modern computing.
Storing Instructions
Each computer processor understands a series of instructions. Each instruction is a binary
sequence. Each processor has its own set of instructions that it understands. These instructions
carry out actions on the data that is stored in the memory. This may mean moving data from
memory to another location, such as a register in the processor, or adding data from two different
locations together.
These instructions are located in one part of the computer’s memory while the data is located in a
different part. Both the data and the instructions can be accessed via the address of the memory
location. The instructions have two parts to them. The instruction and the memory address of the
data they are operating on. As these instructions and the memory addresses are both binary, this
can cause problems for programmers who need to write instructions in this way.
Assembly code is a way of using short text commands and memory addresses instead of binary.
This code can then be converted into binary by an assembler.
Example
LDR R1, [R5]
This LOADs the Register R1 with the value from location R5.
STR R1, [R6]
This STORES the value in register R1 into memory location R6.
The instructions LDR and STR will have specific binary bit patterns that the computer processor
understands. When the computer comes across the bit patterns it knows how to follow that
instruction. Each instruction is followed in turn. Some instructions tell the processor to jump to
another location and carry out instructions from there.
Writing in assembly language is difficult and specific to the type of processor. Most computer
programs are written in a higher programming language.

DATABASES
Introduction
WHAT IS A DATABASE?
A database is a data that is stored in an organised way to make
searching through it to find information easier. We have had databases
long before computers.
Address books are an example. People would have a special book to
write the names an addresses of the people who you know stored in
alphabetical order. So if you wanted to write to Becky Smith you would
open your book to the S section and look through until you found the
entry for Becky Smith. The problem with address books is that while they have sections for each
letter of the alphabet, the entries within each section are probably not in any order. If you have 30
names and addresses under one letter, you would still have to look at each in turn until you found
the correct one. This is because you may enter a new name and address into the book at anytime.
You may have entered the name and address for Becky Smith and then a week later you make
friends with Marla Singer and add her into your address book. Singer is before Smith in the alphabet
and so they would not be in order. Also when people move houses updating the book becomes
messy as old addresses are crossed out.
Card files
The some of the problems with data stored in books can be
solved by having data on cards. New cards can be added or
replaced and they can be resorted when new cards are
added. This is how recipe cards are organised so new ones
can be added. The cards can be organised in different ways,
either by main ingredient, or by type of meal (lunch or main
meal or dessert).
In Library’s card file systems have been used to help people
find the books they want. There are often two card file systems
in libraries. One has the cards ordered by book title and another set has the books ordered by
author name. This duplication of data is one of the disadvantages
of a paper based database. Also the way the data is currently
organised may make searching for data problematic.
When I check my home telephone to see if someone has called
whilst I was out (using 1471) I am only given the telephone
number of the person who has called. If I can only remember a
handful of telephone numbers then how could I find out who had
called me? I don’t want to call back someone who I don’t wish to
What is a database? Page 95
DATABASES
speak to (a cold calling sales person for example) but then again the call may be from someone who
I do wish to speak with. As my paper address book is organised by the surnames of the people in it,
I cannot easily search through each entry to find the phone number, to see if it is someone I know.
When computers began to be used to store data, searching for data became easier. The computer
could sort the data in different ways and I could search through the data more effectively. The
address book on my phone allows me to search through the list by either forename, surname,
telephone number and even post code.
There is special software that manages and searches through databases. These types of software
are know as Database Management Software (DBMS).
Flat File Databases
The databases I have discussed so far can be described as flat file databases. The data is stored as
a record. Each record has a number of fields to store data. This is like a table made up of rows and
columns.
A table column is a database field such as First name, last name and phone number. Each record
would have data for each of these fields. Looking at the flat file database below we can see that the
column headings are the fields and the rows are the individual records.
This data can be searched, to find out who is attending for example. It can also be sorted, in order
of surname or by how many in the party.

Problems with Flat File Databases
There are problems however with flat file computer databases. These problems occur when the
number of fields increase. Look at the table below.
This flat file database is for a hospital that loans out equipment to out patients. In the database data
about both the patient and the item loaned needs to be stored. As items are returned then the item
can appear in the database more than once. So you can see that the Crutch Adult - CA1 gets
loaned more than once, as does Crutch Adult - CA2. Patients can also return, so their details will
need to be entered for every item that is loaned to them. This duplication of data is time consuming
to enter and also makes the database very large very quickly, making searching through it slower.
Duplicating data is known as data redundancy.
Another problem is that items can only be entered if they are loaned out. What happens if there is a
new wheel chair WCL2. This would only get entered if when it is loaned out. This is not good record
keeping. Also if a patient changed their address, do you update the past records too or leave them.
This may look like two different patients if you do not, but this could be a lot of updates if you do.
In order to fix these problems the data can be split up into smaller tables that can be linked together.
This is called a relational database.

What is a database? Page 98
DATABASES
DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
The database is the file or files that store the data. Often this data is separate from the program that
actually manipulates that data. The application used to access, manipulate and present the data is
known as a Database Management System (DBMS). The separation of the data from the DBMS is
often desirable for a number of reasons.
• Standard way of Accessing Data - the DBMS provides a uniform way of accessing the data,
regardless of how that data is stored. Many DBMS’s use a special programming language called
SQL (Structured Query Language) to access the data. The DBMS uses these SQL commands to
access the data in the databases. This may mean pulling together data from a number of
separate files. SQL can be used both to create new databases and tables as well as accessing
and querying existing databases.
• Security - The DBMS provides a level of security around the data, allowing you to password
protect the data and even giving different users different access.
• Multi User Access - the database can be accessed by different users and even different
applications at the same time. This means that the data could be accessed through a website by
one user and by an administrator updating records through the DBMS software.
• Data Maintenance - The DBMS makes sure that the data is stored efficiently and also keeps data
integrity. If a record exists in one table that is linked to data in another table, the DBMS makes
sure that you cannot delete one record without also deleting related records.
Modern databases are often relational databases and so the software used to create and manage
such systems are known as Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS). Examples of
which include Microsoft Access, MySQL and Base which is included in the Open Office suite of
applications.
DBMS Page 99

SOLVING THE PROBLEMS OF FLAT FILE DATABASES
Looking again at our bad flat file database we can see that the first issue is that that we have
duplication of a lot of data. This is known as data redundancy.
A relational database solves this by separating the data into different tables. To do this we use the
concept of entities. An entity is a thing. This can be a physical thing like a customer or a item to be
loaned, or it can be a concept like the loan itself. Each entity is stored in its own table. However
these entities are related to each other and so we need a way of keeping this relationship intact.
Each record in a table is unique and is given a unique identifier. This identifier is used to create a link
between tables. An identifier can be any field as long as its unique. Unfortunately unique fields are
hard to come by, so often a number is often generated that is unique. This is why we often have ID
numbers for this like passports, bank accounts and student IDs in schools.
Looking at our bad flat file database we can see that we only have 3 patients that are in the
database multiple times. We can create a Patient table and create an unique ID for each record in
the table. The unique ID field is known as a Primary Key. A Primary Key is a field that uniquely

identifies a record in that table. In table below we can see our new Patient Table with the PatientID
as the primary key.
Now we need to link this data to the item loan. Looking at the loan table now we have removed the
patient data from the table. In its place we have the patientID which is the primary key from the
Patient table.
A field that contains a primary key from another table is known as a foreign key. Foreign keys are
used to create a link between tables. So in record 5 in the Loans table we can see that Patient 1
loaned the crutch. We can use the patient ID to look up who that is in the Patient table. We can see
that the patient with the patientID of 1 is Homer Simpson. Using a foreign key in the loan table
means that we do not have to duplicate all the patient data when they loan an item.

We still have the item information duplicated. When we remove this entity from the Loans table we
get three tables that can be seen in below.
This type of database is known as a Relational Databases due to the relationships between each
table. A RDBMS has a number of components that are used to access the data stored in the
database. Accessing the data directly through the tables is not recommended. Often data is
accessed through forms, queries and reports.

DATABASES
Forms
A form is used for data entry.
They provide a more user
friendly way of entering data
into a table and even multiple
tables in one form. A user form
can also provide some data
validation checks. Validation
checks are used to make sure
that the data is in a valid form
before it is entered. This can
anything from making sure a
telephone number is the
correct length to making sure
an item number actually exists. Forms can also make some database fields read only so that some
data cannot be altered.
Reports
Reports are used to properly
format data from queries or
when the data needs to be
printed out. The reports can
calculate results based on the
data from fields, adding up the
prices to give a grand total for
example.
Relational Databases Page 103
DATABASES
Queries
Queries when the DBMS selects and
searches for specific data from the
database. This can be done using a
specialist language like SQL or can be
done through a query by example
interface which is often easier for
beginners.
Queries are really important in
databases, allowing us to get to the data we need.
Looking back at our hospital loans example database we have three tables. If we wanted to search
for data relating to the loans we would need to start with the loans table.
If we wanted to know what loans patient two had we could query the data using
PatientID = 2
This would return these rows.
We can see that the patient has loaned the same item on two different occasions.
We could find out which which loans were done with patients in Ward W6 by using this query:

Ward = “W6”
That would return this data.
As the field contains text data, the query must put the data in quotes.
MORE COMPLEX QUERIES USING LOGICAL
OPERATORS
Sometimes we need to select data between particular ranges. If we wanted to know about all the
loans in may 2013 we would need all the dates equal to or greater than 1st May and all those below
or equal to 31st May.
DateLoaned >= 1/05/2013 AND DateLoaned<= 31/05/2013
That would return the following data.
The query uses the AND keyword to make sure that both criteria are met. The date must be both
greater than or equal to 1/05/2013 AND be less than or equal to 31/05/2013.

If we wanted all the adult crutch loans we could perform this query.
ItemCode = “CA1” OR ItemCode = “CA2”
That would return these rows.
We use the OR keyword to make sure we return records that match either “CA1” or “CA2”. Each
record can only be one or the other, not both so here we need to use the OR operator.
AND & OR are know as logical operators. NOT is another logical operator. It means do not get
records that have this value.
Another way of performing the last query is to use a wildcard. A wildcard is a symbol (usually an
asterisk) to represent any other letters or numbers.
So the query
ItemCode = “CA”*
is the same as
ItemCode = “CA1” OR ItemCode = “CA2”.
ItemCode = “CA1” OR ItemCode = “CA2” Query Results

DATABASES
DATA VALIDATION
It is important that the data in a database is sensible and correct. Validation helps in this process by
checking to see if the data being entered is sensible and valid and in the correct format.You often
see this being performed on web forms which often send their data into a database.
One database may contain a table to store bookings. One field may store the date for the booking.
We could enter the data as 21/3/2014 or 21st March 2014. Americans often put the month first so
they would enter 3/21/2014. If we are going to be able to search through the data we need to store
it consistently. Validation can help us enter data in the correct format. Validation is also used to make
sure the data is sensible. 30th Feb 2014 is not a valid date, so we should not allow that to be
entered into our database.
There are different types of validation checks that can be
performed on data before it is allowed into our database.
• Presence check - This is the simplest of all validation
checks. it simply checks to see if data is being entered into
a field. Often these fields have an asterisk showing they are
required and are highlighted if they are left blank.
• Date Check - This field will often be a calendar to make
sure a valid date is selected. The calendar ensures it shows
they correct year, allowing the user to pick easily.
• Range Check - This type of validation ensures that
numerical data is between a particular range. Shoe sizes
may go from 4 to 12 on a particular online shopping site.
• Length Check - This will check to see if the length of the
data is acceptable. Mobile phone numbers, ISBN numbers
and credit card numbers all have particular lengths. If the
data was too short of too long then the data would not be
valid.
• Format check - Some fields require data to be in a
particular format. Some product codes may need to have a
combination of letters and numbers in a particular order. Car
registrations have to follow a particular format, so do Post
Codes. National insurance numbers follow a particular
format, LL 99 99 99 L where L is a letter and 9 is a number
0-9.
• Lookup check - This type of validation looks up the data to
make sure it exists. This could be a product number in a
catalogue superstore or a car registration number on an
insurance website.
Database Task Page 109
DATABASES
• Check digit - Some numbers end in a number that is calculated from the previous numbers.
Credit card numbers, ISBN numbers and barcodes all have a check digit. If any number is
incorrectly entered the check digit calculated will not match the one entered.
Validation does not check to see if the data is correct, only if the data is sensible and valid. If a field
asked me to enter my date of birth I could enter 21/3/1981. This would be a valid date, but it is not
by true birthdate.
Some fields are difficult to validate. People’s names are very hard to validate. While most people
have names that probably appear and a baby naming book, what about foreign names and those
parents who give their children made up names. In New Zealand some children were named
Violence; Number 16 Bus Shelter; Midnight Chardonnay; Benson and Hedges.( http://
news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7522952.stm) These names would be hard to validate for.
Database Task Page 110
DATABASES
SEPARATING DATA FROM APPLICATIONS
Having a database on a single user computer is perhaps OK for a small business but usually the
databases needs to be accessed by a number of people, sometimes millions of people.
Often the database will be stored on a server, allowing access via a number of different applications.
A search engine like Google has a database of web-pages on the Internet and keywords that link to
them. This database can be accessed through a web-browser, but the same data can be displayed
through the GoogleMaps application on a mobile phone.
FaceBook store millions of accounts in their database along with all the data people post online. This
data can be accessed via a web browser, or mobile app but can also be accessed via games like
Candy Crush or Words with Friends, allowing you to see which of your friends are playing the game.
The separation of the data in the database from the application that uses it gives the users greater
flexibility in how the data can be used.

COMPUTER COMMUNICATION & NETWORKING
WHY NETWORK COMPUTERS?
Joining computers together, either with cabling such as ethernet or wirelessly can be complex, so
why do we do it? There are many reasons why we would want to network computer together. The
main reason is to share. This may be to share files and data, or a resources like a printer or a
connection to the Internet.
TYPE OF NETWORK
There are different types of computer network. They can be defined by the relationship the
computers have with each other and the way they are joined together. We will look first at the
relationship between each computer.
Peer to Peer
All stations are joined together in the network have equal status. If you have a number of computers
at home on sharing a wireless router then this is the type of network you will probably have. Each
device shares the connection to the Internet, whether that is a tablet, games console or computer.
You may have other shared resources like a printer or even a media server. You may be able to get
access to your media server through your tablet or games console, to stream music or video on to
your TV.
So in a peer to peer network, there is no central computer or data store. You may be able to share
data from one computer to another. This needs to be set up on each device and is not done
centrally.
Applications may be stored on different computers and accessed by all as longer as the owner gives
permission. Work is backed up on individual user PCs.
In a peer to peer network you get the benefit of being able to share resources but each computer
must be set up individually. This is fine for the home but becomes inefficient the more computers you
have.
Client-Server Network
A client-server network has different types of computers. A powerful central computer called a
server manages the client computers the users use. The data is stored centrally. This means that it
does not matter which client computer the user logs on to, they can still access all their work.
In a client server network, the client computers can be managed centrally from the server. This
means that installation of programs, back ups, security and access rights can all be managed from
one place. This can save a great deal of time. However this does mean there is a reliance of this
central computer. If the server goes down then no-one can access anything. Also it is more
technically challenging to set up and maintain such a network. This means there is often someone
responsible for managing the computer. For large networks this is the most efficient and flexible
despite the reliance on the central computers. Effort is taken to make sure this central computer is
always backed up and working properly.

Computers can be joined together in different ways. The way they are joined together is known as
topology. There are three main network topologies that we need to be aware of.

LOCAL AREA NETWORKS AND WIDE AREA NETWORKS
As well as being able to describe a network based on its topology, we can also describe a network
in terms of geography.
A Local Area Network (LAN) is a network that is on one geographical location. This may be just one
room of computers or as big as a single site, covering a number of buildings. The computers are all
connected together through wiring such as ethernet, fibre optic or wireless LAN.
Some large organisations have more than one site, but still need to communicate between sites.
These separate LANs are joined together through the telephone networks to create a Wide Area
Network or WAN. The Internet is the biggest WAN, joining together millions of computers.
Types of Network Page 124
COMPUTER COMMUNICATION & NETWORKING
HOW COMPUTERS COMMUNICATE
ADDRESSING
Each computer on a network needs to be uniquely identified so that data can be sent and received
from it. There are many different ways of doing this.
Protocols are used to help control network communication. Protocols are a set of rules that all the
devices on a network must follow if they are to be able to communicate with each other.
When connected to a network or the Internet each computer will have an Internet Protocol address
or IP address. This is made up of 4 bytes. We often see this as a series of 4 numbers ranging from
0-255 separated by full stops. So 10.1.128.240 is an example of an IP address. Computers use
these addresses to communicate with each other in the same way we use phone numbers.
These numbers are hard for people to remember, so on the Internet each IP address of a website
has a domain name, a text based name that is easier to remember. See the next section for more
details.
As well as IP addresses, each network interface in a computer (ethernet card or wifi card) also has a
unique Media Access Control address or MAC address. Each device usually has this address
hardwired into them when they are manufactured. Again these addresses help a network identify
each device, making sure that data travels to the correct destination.
PACKETS AND PROTOCOLS
Imagine you are an author and you have written a 500 page manuscript which must be sent by post.
The problem is that due to the postal charges, you can only send 50 pages at a time.
How do you get the manuscript to your publishers, so they can assemble it correctly?
Firstly you would split your document into 50 page sections, putting each into an envelope. On the
envelope you would put the publisher’s address as well as your own address, so they know who
sent it. You would also need to label each envelope so that the publisher know which set of pages
were in each. So the first one would be labelled packet 1/10 pages 1-50, the second packet 2/10
pages 51-100 etc. Then the envelopes could be posted and the publisher knows from the
envelopes how to reassemble to manuscript. It does not matter if the envelopes do not arrive in
order. If one goes missing, the publisher can figure out which one it is and ask for a replacement.
This is how data gets sent around networks.

SECURITY ON NETWORKS
When we have so many users on a network, security becomes a big issue. In big companies and
organisations, while they often want to be able to access data from any computer on their network,
it does not mean that every employee should have the same access to all the data and programs.
How does a network manager make sure that their network is kept secure?

MANAGING A NETWORK
A computer network needs a great deal of
effort to manage and keep it running
smoothly. Computer networks often have
A network manager who has a number of
responsibilities.
Each user often has just signed an
acceptable use policy. This document in
forms the users have a network can be
used in an acceptable way. This may be
different for each organisation. For
example some companies may prohibit
the use of USB memory sticks, as they
may be a source of viruses and other
malware as well as be a device to steal
sensitive documents. An acceptable use
policy would also cover the use of the
Internet. Internet use in a company is often
monitored and any unacceptable use could result in the employee being disciplined or even sacked.
Another task needs to be completed is that of archiving and backing up of data. Computer hardware
like hard disks can fail. This would result in the loss of all the data that was on the disk. Backing up
means copying that data onto another storage medium such as another hard disk, a tape or the
cloud. If I hard disk was to fail and data could be restored from the backup onto a new hard disk.

THE INTERNET
The Internet is an enormous network of networks. Today almost a third of the entire Earth's
population uses the Internet. We get access to the Internet through Internet Service Providers or
ISPs. These companies attach to the Internet proper. We connect with them through fixed line or
mobile phone networks. The Internet is uses a number of technologies to transfer data. Email, World
Wide Web, File Transfer, Messaging all use the Internet.
The services that make up the Internet, such as the World Wide Web, are hosted on thousands of
computers all over the world. Special servers allow access to data and transfer this from server to
computer. The world wide web for example is hosted on web servers by a variety of web hosting
companies and private companies. These web servers host the webpages and other files that
people want to view.
When you browse the Internet using a web browser, a number of things happen when you request a
page. Normally when we request a page we type in a web address or click on a hyperlink to an
address. For example if we clicked on a link to http://www.bbc.co.uk your web browser is making a
request to that computer. Computers however don't have names, they are identified by numbers
known as IP addresses. These addresses are stored on special servers called Domain Name
Service servers. These are a little like telephone directories. The name of the website is looked up in
one of the DNS servers and finds out the IP address of the web host. The message then gets
passed on to that server at the BBC. The web server understands that a web page has been asked
for. It then sends this page back to the computer that asked for it.
The Internet is often described as a Mesh topology. Draw a mesh network. What are the
advantages of a mesh network?

WEB PAGES
There are billions of web pages on the Internet. These pages are all written in a special language
called Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).
HTML is the language of the World Wide Web. Every web page that you have looked at is written in
this language. HTML is a text based language that tells the web browser (Internet Explorer, Google
Chrome and the like) how to display the page.
HTML is made up of tags that describe to the web browser how to display the web page. Tags are
surrounded by less than and greater than signs, < tag >.
Tags generally come in pairs. One tag opens the formatting and the closing tag ends the formatting.
A closing tag has a slash ( / ) to show that it is a closing tag.
TAGS
All web pages start with a <html> tag and end with the closing </html> tag. This tells the web
browser that the page is a web page.
Web pages are divided into two sections. The head section contains information that is not
displayed in the main browser window. This is often JavaScript code that can make the page
interactive or style information that can make a page look more colourful. The next section is the
body section. Everything in this section is displayed inside the browser window.

TAG ATTRIBUTES
Many tags have attributes. These are keywords followed by a value in quotes.
Eg:
<table width=“70%”>
The table tag has a width attribute that is set to 70%. This means the table is 70% of the browser
window. A common attribute is a tag’s id. This can be used by JavaScript to select a tag to change
it.
CSS
Another web technology is cascading style sheets or CSS. These help provide more style
information as to how the browser displays the content. CSS cover things like colours and borders
and helps with organising the layout of the content. Often one style sheet can be used to style a
series of pages giving them a similar appearance.
Changing a style sheet can be used to dramatically change the appearance of a web page without
actually changing the underlying HTML code. This means that web designers can keep their
websites looking fresh without having to rewrite all their web pages and often by only altering one
style sheet.
JAVASCRIPT
To make web pages interactive a programming language must be used. JavaScript is a script based
interpreted language that can be embedded in webpages to allow for interactivity and animation. A
combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript can be used to create complex interactive websites and
even games. A version of Angry Birds and Cut the Rope is playable online and all programmed using
HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Javascript is often used to validate forms. This prevents data that is not sensible or acceptable from
being submitted to websites for processing.

COMPUTER COMMUNICATION & NETWORKING
FILES OF THE INTERNET
Web pages are pure text files. The HTML, CSS and JavaScript that make up web pages can be
viewed using any simple text editor. It is the web browser than converts the tags into the formatting
we see when we view a page. So what about things like images, sounds and videos? These files are
linked to inside the HTML code. When the web browser finds these links it requests them from the
web server and when they have been downloaded, inserts them into the page.
There are some special file formats that have been developed for use on the Internet. Usually these
formats are compressed in some way to speed up download times.
COMPRESSION
Sending large files over the Internet takes time. Back when most people had dial up modems to
connect to the Internet, it was very slow to download a web page, 30 seconds or more for a page
with lots of images. Making sure that the image file sizes were small helped to make sure that these
download times were as low as possible.
Nowadays most people have broadband and pages generally load pretty fast. However there is an
increasing number of people access the Internet on a mobile phone and file sizes not only affect
speed of download but also affect peoples data limit.
Compressing a file means finding a way to save the same data into a smaller space. One way to do
this is to use an algorithm to search for repeating patterns. In many files there is data that is
repeated. Instead of saving all the data multiple times in a file it is just saved once. When the data is
repeated a code referring to the data is used instead.
